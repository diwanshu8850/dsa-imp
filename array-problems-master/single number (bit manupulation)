Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements 
appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans=0;
        
        // take xor of whole array as numbers are repeated twice (a^a=0) 
        // at the end we have our two required numbers xored
        for(auto i:nums){
            ans^=i;
        }
        int x;
        
        // find the set bit in the xor as at that bit both numbers differ
        // and we will have two sets with one required number in each
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++){
            if(ans&(1<<i)){
                x=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        int a=0,b=0;
        
        // make the two sets and the xor of the two different sets
        // will give us our ans as whole the numbers except 2 are repeated twice
        for(auto i:nums){
            if(i&(1<<x)){
                a^=i;
            } else{
                b^=i;
            }
        }
        return {a,b};
    }
